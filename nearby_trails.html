									<h2>Local Trails to Visit</h2>
								</header>

								<p>
								Living in or nearby College Park, Maryland, can feel limiting due
								to our urban environment, but there are a countless number of trails
								that can be visited in our state. Regardless of whether you are looking
								for an easy stroll through the woods or a challenging hike up a mountain,
								Maryland’s wilderness offers beautiful sights and interesting formations
								that are a blast to visit and explore.
							  </p>

								<h2>Northwest Branch</h2>

								<p>If you’re looking for a beautiful and relaxing hike extremely
								close to College Park, we recommend visiting the Northwest Branch
								and Rachel Carson Greenway trails. Anyone can enjoy either trail’s
								cutaway from urban life, with multiple paths following the beautiful
								Northwest Branch stream in one of Montgomery County’s “best natural areas.” [1]
								The trails accommodate bikes and rollerblades with a 2.7 mile paved path,
								and hikers and equestrians are free to enjoy a 10.2 mile unpaved path.
								Regardless of what you are planning for the day, you can get a
								great workout and enjoy the nature of Maryland without traveling
								far from home by visiting this area.</p>

								<p>
								The Terps Hike team visited the Rachel Carson trail in early
								November so that we could give a personal review of the location.
								Although we did not get to cover the whole trail, we had a great
								time exploring and enjoyed the breath of fresh air.
							  </p>

								[Another on-location picture]

								<p>
								Our hike began by snaking between large boulders, making our way
								down into the river valley. With towering rocks and multiple
								small waterfalls, this is an area that is beautiful and
								especially fun for those who enjoy climbing. In the summer months,
								rock climbing groups can often be found practicing here. As we
								traveled further, the rocks became less frequent and the river
								calm. We found ourselves in the depths of the woods with a relaxing
								stream to our side. For those who enjoy wildlife, squirrel, deer,
								foxes, and many types of birds can be encountered in this area.
								</p>

									[More pictures]


								<p>
								We found the trail to be very relaxing as well as engaging, and
								are planning on returning again soon. Regardless of the size of
								your party, this trail works very well for a simple afternoon
								excursion to enjoy the weather and take in nature. For those who
								are interested, directions to the trail can be found here.

								<h2>Rivers, Mountains, and Other Trails</h2>

								<p>
								If you are fan of heights, we also suggest visiting the the Billy
								Goat Trail, which provides beautiful views of the Potomac river
								as well as a more active adventure for those who enjoy climbing.
								The unpaved trail is roughly 5 miles long, with multiple locations
								to enjoy the scenery and climb on large rocks.[1] The trail also
								connects to a paved pathway for easy access to the Great Falls
								Tavern Visitor Center, where you can park. If you have additional
								time, we strongly recommend viewing the Great Falls rapids as well,
								either by following the paths near the visitor center, or by visiting
								the Great Falls National Park on the opposite side of the Potomac, in Virginia.
							  </p>
								<p>
								If you prefer mountains over rivers, Sugarloaf Mountain in Frederick County,
								Maryland is another great location to visit that isn’t extremely challenging,
								but very rewarding. With an elevation of 1,282 [2] feet, Sugarloaf can be climbed
								quickly, while still providing beautiful views of the surrounding landscape. Hiking,
								rock climbing, horseback riding, and bird watching are all activities that visitors
								can enjoy at this location.
							  </p>
								<p>
								Additionally, picnic areas at the scenic overlook
								(which is accessible by car) and summit offer a
								great opportunity for friends and family to enjoy
								the outdoors alongside a meal.
								</p>
							  <p>
								If these trails don’t catch your attention, don’t fret!
								There are many more locations to visit in Maryland than we could
								possibly list. Feel free to visit http://www.alltrails.com,
								which is a wonderful resource complete with in-depth information
								and reviews of trails across the globe.
