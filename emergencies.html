									<h2><b>Emergency Equipment and First Aid</b></h2>
										<p>
											When out on the trail, even seemingly innocent injuries can
											quickly become extremely dangerous. Regardless of if you are
											planning a day hike or a multi-week backcountry trip, gathering
											safety equipment and understanding basic first-aid is necessary,
											and can actually save lives.

								<h2>Safety Equipment</h2>
								<p>
								Dr. David Tyler<sup><a href="sources.html#Emergencies">1</a></sup> is a surgeon and an editor of “Trail Medicine,”
								a column which focuses on preparing for and treating health issues
								while hiking. Dr. Tyler suggests bringing along, at the very least,
								a “first aid kit containing clean bandages, moleskin for blisters,
								band-aids, a roll of tape, and perhaps some mild pain medicine
								such as aspirin, Tylenol, or ibuprofen.” On top of a first aid kit,
								packing additional food and drink is another proper way to prepare
								for an emergency situation, such as if you became stranded and must
								wait for help.
							  </p>
								<p>
								As always, remember to consider the possibility of having to stay outside overnight,
								and potentially having to endure life-threatening conditions like sub-freezing temperatures
								and snow, depending on the season and location. Waterproof gear, and clothing which is appropriate
								for the elements, limit the dangers of these conditions, although they should not be underestimated.
								Kyle Ludwig, President of the University of Maryland’s Terrapin Trail Club, has witnessed group members
								experience mild hypothermia during a long hike. While his group was prepared for the situation and able
								to act appropriately, he also explained, “if you're out with no contact, then [hypothermia] becomes an
								emergency situation where you need to warm them up yourself, but also get them back to society and make
								sure they're okay.” It is easy to imagine how this situation can become far worse without the help of friends,
								which is why it is also much safer (and usually more enjoyable) to plan longer trips with others! Regardless
								of your party size, remember to let someone know where and when you are going on a trip, and try to keep a
								connection to civilization in some way, such as with a cell phone or emergency radio.
								</p>

								<h2>Treating Injuries</h2>
								<p>
								If you find yourself hurt on a hike, basic first aid skills can
								get you a long way. For sprains, Dr. Tyler recommends “immobilization
								and elevation of the injured area,” adding that in the event of
								a fracture a rudimentary splint can be constructed with sticks
								and tape. Smaller sticks work well as splints for broken fingers,
								although Dr. Tyler also suggests simply taping broken fingers or
								toes to neighboring ones. Injuries to the ankle, feet, and toes,
								have the added danger of restricting movement. If you are hiking
								alone and can no longer move, these injuries can justify the use
								of emergency devices such as a radio to call for help.
								</p>
								<p>
								Cuts are rarely life-threatening and generally a lot easier to
								treat than other injuries. The most effective solution is to
								elevate the area affected and apply pressure directly to the
								wound with a bandage until bleeding stops, according to Dr. Tyler.
								However, if you find yourself unable to stop a large amount of
								bleeding, you may have a serious and life-threatening situation
								due to a cut into an artery. Dr. Tyler adds:</p>
								<blockquote>
								The only time a tourniquet may be valuable is when there is uncontrollable
								arterial bleeding. Bright red blood that is pumping out is arterial,
								while venous blood is darker and flows constantly...
								To be effective a tourniquet must be applied tightly
								enough to exceed the arterial blood pressure.
								This cuts off the blood flow to the extremity.
								</blockquote><br/>
								<p>
								While the advice offered here can help in an emergency, we
								strongly encourage you to attend a wilderness-focused first aid
								course before you begin hiking. You can visit
								<a href="http://www.nols.edu/wmi/courses/wildfirstaid.shtml">this</a> page
								to enroll in a two-day course and become certified.
								If an injury other than a cut, sprain, or fracture has occurred on the trail,
								it is likely that advanced medical attention is necessary and should be called immediately.
