								<p>When you go hiking, wildlife surrounds you whether you notice it or not. If you would like to birdwatch on your hike, there are plenty of ways to get started.
								Birds are a common sight on campus, but if you enter more wooded areas while hiking, you will
								see a wider variety of birds. The easiest birds to sight as a beginner in this area are
								American Robins, Blue Jays, Baltimore Orioles, and Northern Cardinals because they all have
								distinctive coloring patterns that are recognizable.</p>
								<p>If you are interested in figuring out a mystery bird you spot on your hike, there are many
								apps available for free. The Audubon Birds App gives you the ability to search through birds,
								first by their type, then by similarly shaped birds, and finally through images of different
								birds. For example, if you see want to find the American Robin within the app, you would first
								select perching birds, then the most similar picture, thrushes, then you would see the picture
								of the American Robin in the list of thrushes.</p>
								<a class="image featured"><img src="images/Bird App.PNG" title="Source: Audubon Birds" /></a>
								<p>The app also has the ability to search for recent bird sightings near College Park, so the
								list of birds you need to look through may be shorter if someone else has observed that bird
								locally. </p>	</article>
