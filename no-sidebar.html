<p>
 Terrapin Trail Club (TTC) is a student-run outdoors club within the University of Maryland, providing opportunities for members to go 
 hiking, backpacking, and camping, in the nearby area. The club itself provides equipment so that anyone interested in trying new
 activities can jump right in. Members often take weekends or afternoons into the mountains and forests of Maryland, Virginia, Delaware,
 and other surrounding states. On top of exploring the wilderness on-foot, some members of the club also enjoy spelunking, rock climbing,
 mountain biking, and kayaking.
</p>
<p>
 Kyle Ludwig is the president of Terrapin Trail Club. From backpacking to spelunking, Kyle is an avid outdoorsman, and he was eager to
 share with us some information about the club and his experiences hiking. Of course, we had to ask where the best places to visit 
 nearby are:
</p>

<blockquote>
 I love going to Seneca Rocks, which we do twice a year. We lead a big trip, bringing about 50 people out there —
 we do all of our activities at once — we call it "intro trip." I don't know if it's necessarily the place, or if it's 
 just the fact that I've gone there 10+ times with completely different groups every time. It's just cool to do all of 
 those things at one place, so that's one of my favorite places to go.<br>

 I've been backpacking down the Grand Canyon — that was probably my favorite trip I've ever been on. I've also been to Iceland,
 which was cool to go exploring out there. Not super common place to get to go but that wasn't a TTC trip. Those are some of
 the best places I've been to.
</blockquote>

<p>What are some lesser known local trails that you enjoy?</p>

<blockquote>
 It's not the best trail in the world but a lot of people don't realize that
 Greenbelt Park is five minutes away from here, and it's a great place to be able
 to get away. There's nothing spectacular about it but it exists, it's an urban
 setting and a lot of fun if you're only able to go for a few hours. There are
 also some local mountain biking trails up near beltsville. And Carter Rock for
 rock climbing, about half an hour away. It's cool how many random places there
 are around here – even in an urban environment.
</blockquote>


<p>What dangers should new hikers be looking out for on the trail?</p>


<blockquote>
 Over the long-term, the most important things to take care of beyond basic
 first aid knowledge, being able to call for help, and letting people know where
 you're going, is to – on a personal level – be very wary of your water
 intake, food intake, and your feet. Nothing is worse than getting a few days
 out, especially if you are going on a long backpacking trip – and your feet
 are killing you – and then you find yourself not being able to walk back.
 Water and food, you'll need a lot more than you normally would out on the back
 country or even on a day hike. You need to make sure you're keeping track of
 your intake and plan ahead before you go. If you set out food for a day, you
 need to make sure you eat all of that for the day so you have enough energy.
</blockquote>


<p>Have you ever encountered any issues when you've been out on the trail?</p>


<blockquote>
 We've had fatigue and feet problems, but nothing too severe. In the colder
 weather you need to make sure you're dressed warm enough, and dressed smartly.
 Don't wear a giant ski jacket going hiking because you're going to end up
 sweating, and the only layer you'll have to take off is your ski jacket, so you
 got to dress in layers to adjust to the environment.<br>

 We've had people get hypothermia for sure, mild hypothermia but still. That's
 not good, in that trip specifically it was a very very very long hike, about 46
 miles in a day – an endurance thing for sure – but we had people following us
 along the way so it was easy for that person to go into the car and stop. But if
 you're out with no contact, then it becomes an emergency situation where you
 need to warm them up yourself but also get them back to society and make sure
 they're okay.
</blockquote>


<p>Do you make any specific recommendations regarding gear influenced by
 Maryland climate or terrain?</p>


<blockquote>
 If you know the weather situation you're going to be facing, [hiking is]
 going to be a lot easier. If it's going to be cold, dress in layers. The
 bigger, fatter, heavier the jacket does not make it warmer. I work at REI, and
 people come in all the time saying "I have this big coat" – I don't care how
 big your coat is. It's probably not as warm as this light, three ounce thing
 I'm holding up. You need to make sure you're getting things suited for outdoor
 activities, not just staying warm in general. Cotton, in general, is the worst
 thing you could ever bring outside. It gets wet, it'll keep cold, and won't dry
 very quickly. Natural and synthetic materials, like wool, are much better. They
 take a little bit longer to dry, but if they're wet they'll still keep warm.
 Synthetic materials dry very quickly, they end up stinking a little bit quicker,
 which is sort of the downside of them. In this environment, having a warm
 layer, having something you can wear underneath everything – a base layer –
 and then an outer shell to keep the elements off in the winter, is preferable.
 In the summer, your shorts, they can be cotton, but if nothing else athletic
 shorts are good, because they are usually athletic. Non-cotton shirts are good.
</blockquote>

<p>What kind of wildlife can a hiker in Maryland expect or hope to see?</p>

<blockquote>
 You can come across bears. Especially if you go out to Western Maryland –
 Garrett County, the western, more mountainous counties – you can come across
 black bears and other little critters at night. The only thing of really any
 danger you can come across are bears and deer that aren't used to seeing people,
 but they're usually easily scared so that’s fine. Black bears are also
 relatively easily scared, but if you're planning on going somewhere where you
 know there are black bears it's good to brush up on what to do if you come
 across one. I went on one backpacking trip, and in four days, I came across
 five or six black bears – and that was just in the shenandoah.
</blockquote>


<p>Would you suggest bringing mace or something like that with you if you want
to scare away bears? Or just making yourself big?</p>


<blockquote>
 Make yourself big, make yourself loud. They are, for the most part, going to be
 more afraid of you than you are of them. If you come across cubs, then you
 should be a lot more wary of what you're going to do, but still follow the same
 protocol. Bear mace is a bit overkill for black bears, but if you're really
 nervous about them and you're worried you're going to freeze and they're going
 to attack you (which they probably won’t), bear mace is fine, but it weighs a
 lot and it’s kind of annoying to bring around and it’s dangerous to have around
 – because it’s a lot worse than human mace – so you can get it, but you don't
 necessarily need it.
</blockquote>


<p>Do you have any other advice for people with little to no experience hiking
 who want to get out more?</p>


<blockquote>
 Take it easy, take it slow. If a trail says intermediate your first time, even
 if you're in good shape running or other things, you’ll probably be fine out
 there, but you need to make sure you ease into the harder outdoor activities.
 Just because it’s a different skillset, and building your stamina and gear are
 important. Finding the correct gear can be very important. Your feet can take a
 beating if you have the wrong boots, for example – even if they fit you, they
 can still be uncomfortable in certain ways. So don't go crazy your first time
 out, and do some research on what you can expect on that trail. There are plenty
 of websites and apps around that show you trails in the area and what to expect.
</blockquote>


<p>Do you have anything else you'd like to share?</p>


<blockquote>
 TTC is a student-led club, unlike the Maryland Adventure Program, so we don't
 have professional University-of-Maryland-paid staff trip leaders. Students are
 the only ones leading the trips, so I think it’s a lot more unique in that it
 has a lot more potential to be just friends going on a trip instead of "I'm
 paying you 100 dollars to take me backpacking this weekend". They'll still be
 nice to you and they'll still do all of these things, but it’s a different
 atmosphere I think, so even if it’s not quite as safe on paper – I don't want
 to say it’s unsafe because we've never had any issues – just because we don't
 have people that are trained to quite as high a degree, I think it’s a lot more
 of a real and unique experience. And it’s a great way to find people to hang out
 with. I transferred here and I didn't know more than two or three people when I
 came here originally, and I found out about the club a month or two after I
 came to Maryland, and that's how I met literally all of my friends at UMD.
 It's a cool place. And we have all the gear you'd ever need to do anything, so
 if you don't have any experience, or any gear, its there.
