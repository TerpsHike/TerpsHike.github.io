											<h2><b>Dangerous Plants and Animals</b></h2>
											<p>We are all extremely familiar with the squirrels and deer of Maryland, but what other wild animals can you run into within our forests?
												More importantly, are there any creatures in our wilderness that are an actual threat? These are great questions to ask before going on a trip,
												as the answer can completely change how you should prepare.
											</p>

										According to Maryland’s Department of Natural Resources,<sup><a href="sources.html#Animals">1</a></sup>
										Maryland’s wildlife population includes coyotes and black bears,
										both of which have the capability to harm humans. However,
										neither of these animals are known to actively target humans,
										and in most cases will simply be scared away from an unexpected encounter.
									  The Humane Society reports that there have only been two deaths caused by
										coyotes in the United States and Canada, and that the most
										dangerous situation most people could face is a coyote infected
										with rabies. As with any rabid animal, in this situation it
										is imperative to keep distance and avoid a transfer of the
										animal’s saliva to any open wounds. If you are bitten by a
										rabid animal, seek medical attention immediately, as rabies
										is fatal without treatment. According to the Humane Society,<sup><a href="sources.html#Animals">2</a></sup>
										treatment shortly after contact is 100% effective at curing
										the disease.</p>
										<p>
										If you are exploring western Maryland, black bears are a
										common sight. Maryland’s Department of Natural Resources<sup><a href="sources.html#Animals">3</a></sup> advises
										anyone who comes into contact with a black bear to simply
										leave the area in a calm manner. If a bear approaches your
										campgrounds, the department makes it clear, “<b>DON’T FEED IT!</b>”
										The department elaborates further, explaining that it is illegal
										to feed bears in Maryland, and doing so only makes the bear
										more likely to approach humans in the future. They add that
										the proper reaction to a bear entering your campgrounds is
										to make yourself as large and loud as possible, and as a
										last resort, use “spray repellents containing capsaicin” to
										drive it away. It is important to maintain a pathway for the
										bear to leave through, or it may feel threatened and become
										more aggressive. Above all, remember to stay calm and that
										bears are most likely more afraid of you than you are of
										them.
									</p>
									<p>
									Surprisingly, some of the most common irritations and dangers
									you’ll face on the trail are ones that you cannot easily see:
									mosquitoes, poison ivy, and ticks. Mosquitoes and ticks are
									insects which feed on the blood of other organisms, and can
									carry diseases which humans are susceptible to. Maryland
									contains four types of tick: the wood tick, brown dog tick,
									deer tick, and lone star tick. To avoid ticks, stay away
									from tall grass and other overgrown areas, and wear clothing
									which fully covers your body.<sup><a href="sources.html#Animals">4</a></sup> It is a good practice to
									routinely check yourself for ticks as you hike, so that you
									can easily remove them before they become attached. According
									to the CDC, ticks can transmit Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain
									spotted fever,<sup><a href="sources.html#Animals">5</a></sup> among other illnesses. Similarly, mosquitoes
									are known transmit West Nile virus<sup><a href="sources.html#Animals">6</a></sup> within North America.
									Avoiding mosquito bites can be done by hiking during colder
									months, applying mosquito repellant, and wearing clothes to
									cover exposed skin.

									<p>
									Poison ivy, while not a serious threat to your health,
									is another common annoyance in the woods. The National Park
									Service identifies the plant by its three-leaf pattern, adding
									that “in early summer, yellowish or greenish flowers with five
									petals appear and develop into small round off-white fruits by
									fall. The leaves also turn red in fall.”<sup><a href="sources.html#Animals">7</a></sup> Avoiding contact to
									the oil produced by the plant is the best way to prevent a rash
									or blisters from developing. The NPS adds, “If you've been
									exposed to poison ivy, wash with soap and cool running water,
									preferably within an hour after exposure.”
