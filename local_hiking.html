										<h2>Bird Watching</h2>
										<p>When you go hiking, wildlife surrounds you whether you notice it or not. An increased
										awareness while hiking can give you a glimpse into the world of flora and fauna that makes
										hiking even more enjoyable. Some of the common animals on hiking trails near the University
										of Maryland are a variety of birds, deer, squirrels, groundhogs and rabbits. If you are
										interested in wildlife, UMD has a Wildlife Society open to students aspiring to have a major
										or a career in wildlife sciences. </p>
										<p>If you would like to birdwatch on your hike, there are plenty of ways to get started.
										Birds are a common sight on campus, but if you enter more wooded areas while hiking, you will
										see a wider variety of birds. The easiest birds to sight as a beginner in this area are
										American Robins, Blue Jays, Baltimore Orioles, and Northern Cardinals because they all have
										distinctive coloring patterns that are recognizable.</p>
										<p>If you are interested in figuring out a mystery bird you spot on your hike, there are many
										apps available for free. The Audubon Birds App gives you the ability to search through birds,
										first by their type, then by similarly shaped birds, and finally through images of different
										birds. For example, if you see want to find the American Robin within the app, you would first
										select perching birds, then the most similar picture, thrushes, then you would see the picture
										of the American Robin in the list of thrushes.</p>
										<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/Bird App.PNG" alt="" /></a>
										<p>The app also has the ability to search for recent bird sightings near College Park, so the
										list of birds you need to look through may be shorter if someone else has observed that bird
										locally. </p>
										
										<h2>Terrain</h2>
										<p>Within Maryland, there are vastly different types of environments to hike ranging from sandy
										beaches on the eastern seaboard to the mountainous western regions of Maryland. College Park is
										situated between these two extremes in an area known as the Piedmont region. The Piedmont is
										characterized by valleys and rolling hills leading up to the foothills of the Appalachian
										Mountains. Maryland offers a variety of different terrain to hike depending on how far you want
										to travel to get to your hiking location. With each type of terrain, there are different
										considerations that need to be taken in order to have a safe and enjoyable hiking experience.</p>
										<h3>Piedmont</h3>
										<p>The greatest challenge in the Piedmont region is the variety of terrain difficulty. The
										trails within the Piedmont can range from steep inclines to relatively flat lands. In order to
										prepare for the hike you want to take, it is important that you research the trail and search
										for reviews to get an understanding of the difficulty before you start. In Maryland, these
										trails tend to be closest to population centers, and are therefore better maintained, however
										they will possibly be more crowded.</p>
										<h3>Mountains</h3>
										<p>The mountainous areas of western Maryland have steeper inclines than the Piedmont region,
										and the incline can tire hikers out very easily. Trails in this region are generally unimproved
										and narrow, so be sure to follow the trail blazes and watch your step! There is also a larger
										prevalence of rock scrambles and jagged rocks, so proper footwear may be required for ankle
										support. If the incline is very steep, you can zigzag to decrease the gradient. Following
										switchbacks also preserves the trail and is safer than running straight down the hill, as
										tempting as it may be after working so hard going up!</p>
										<h3>Coastal Plain</h3>
										<p>Hiking at the beach introduces new challenges that are different than hiking anywhere else.
										Hiking along a beach may seem easy at first glance, but the constantly uneven and slippery sand
										stresses your legs more easily than hard, flat surfaces. Trails away from the waterfront will
										generally be hard-packed soil with few rocks or obstacles, except for the occasional tree root.
										Close proximity to the water introduces more insect life, so you should be sure to pack insect
										repellant to avoid unnecessary pain. The heat and the humidity at the beach can be dangerous to
										unprepared hikers. In order to fight the sun’s beams bring sunscreen, a hat, sunglasses, and
										extra drinking water.</p>

										<h2>Seasons</h2>
										<p>No matter what season you choose to go hiking, the weather and temperature are important to
										consider when planning a hike. Check the weather forecast leading up to your hike to avoid
										inclement weather situations and extreme temperatures. Depending on the season, you can enjoy a
										variety of different scenery: fall colors, snow-covered trees, and blossoming flowers. Each
										season bring hikers new experiences to enjoy.</p>
										<h3>Fall</h3>
										<p>As summer draws to a close and fall begins, the temperatures start to become more mild and
										humidity levels begin to drop. As the temperatures begin to decrease, the bright red, oranges,
										and yellows of fall foliage transform forested trails for hikers to enjoy. Another benefit of
										hiking during the fall is the reduction of mosquitoes, biting flies, and other insects from
										colder temperatures. As the fall weather continues to change, the highs and lows throughout the
										day can vary greatly. To prepare for the changing temperatures, pack extra layers in case the
										temperatures drop as the day progresses toward evening. Another downside of the changing weather
										are the cold rains that can catch hikers unprepared as fall continues. In order to avoid getting
										drenched in a rainstorm or thunderstorm, or make sure you bring appropriate raingear, make sure
										to check the weather forecast leading up to your hike.</p>
										<h3>Winter</h3>
										<p>Spring semester begins with winter where we’re all wishing for snow days to get out of class.
										Along with the promise of sleeping in, winter bring incredible views of snow covered trees and
										frozen rivers that you can see during a winter hike. December, January, and February are the
										coldest months of the winter in College park with average lows below freezing. Storms during
										winter bring snow or cold rain, both of which are dangerous because they can rapidly lower your
										body temperature. Long periods outside in cold temperatures will also lower your body temperature.
										With a low body temperature, it is more likely that you get hypothermia or frostbite, so you must
										make sure to wear appropriate clothing and boots that will keep your body warm. Some key winter
										accessories to wear hiking are winter coats, gloves, hats, thick socks, and winter boots. If you
										are walking on snow, it is important that the boots you wear are waterproof to prevent frostbite
										on your toes. In addition to proper clothing, eating extra food prevents hypothermia because it
										provides your body with more energy to produce heat. If your fingers, toes, or other appendages
										start to feel numb, immediately make sure they are dry and add more layers to add warmth.</p>
										<h3>Spring</h3>
										<p>Spring is beginning and that means new life! Flowers start popping out of the ground and buds
										appear on trees. With new life comes a lot of rain, which means the majority of hiking in the
										spring is going to be very muddy. Be aware of cold spells; be sure to pack extra layers if it is
										going to be cold during your hike.Waterproof clothing and packs are important for this season to
										keep yourself and your supplies dry in case of rain. </p>
										<h3>Summer</h3>
										<p>The first few weeks of fall semester and the last few weeks of spring semester are the hottest
										days most of us experience on campus, unless you are staying over the summer. With extreme heat
										and humidity, hikers must be extra cautious to stay hydrated. Hikers should also be aware of air
										quality alerts that indicate elevated levels of pollution that may be unhealthy for those with
										sensitive respiratory systems and popup thunderstorms that can break branches and cause flash
										flooding along the trail. That being said, summer offers longer days that make an evening hike
										possible without racing to beat sunset.</p>
