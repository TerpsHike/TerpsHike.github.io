											<h2><b>Local Trails to Visit</b></h2>
										</header>

										<p>
										Living in or nearby College Park, Maryland, can feel limiting due
										to our urban environment, but there are a countless number of trails
										that can be visited in our state. Regardless of whether you are looking
										for an easy stroll through the woods or a challenging hike up a mountain,
										Maryland’s wilderness offers beautiful sights and interesting formations
										that are a blast to visit and explore.
									  </p>

										<h2>Northwest Branch & Rachel Carson Greenway Trails</h2>

										<p>If you’re looking for a beautiful and relaxing hike extremely
										close to College Park, we recommend visiting the Northwest Branch
										and Rachel Carson Greenway trails. Anyone can enjoy either trail’s
										cutaway from urban life, with multiple paths following the beautiful
										Northwest Branch stream in one of Montgomery County’s “best natural areas.”
										The trails accommodate bikes and rollerblades with a 2.7 mile paved path,
										and hikers and equestrians are free to enjoy a 10.2 mile unpaved path.
										Regardless of what you are planning for the day, you can get a
										great workout and enjoy the nature of Maryland without traveling
										far from home by visiting this area.</p>

										<a class="image featured"><img src="images/NW_1.jpg" title="Source: Dylan Mink"></a>

										<p>
										The Terps Hike team visited the Rachel Carson trail in early
										November so that we could give a personal review of the location.
										Although we did not get to cover the whole trail, we had a great
										time exploring and enjoyed the breath of fresh air.
										</p>

										<p>
										Our hike began by snaking between large boulders, making our way
										down into the river valley. With towering rocks and multiple
										small waterfalls, this is an area that is beautiful and
										especially fun for those who enjoy climbing. In the summer months,
										rock climbing groups can often be found practicing here. As we
										traveled further, the rocks became less frequent and the river
										calm. We found ourselves in the depths of the woods with a relaxing
										stream to our side. For those who enjoy wildlife, squirrel, deer,
										foxes, and many types of birds can be encountered in this area.
										</p>

										<p>
										We found the trail to be very relaxing as well as engaging, and
										are planning on returning again soon. Regardless of the size of
										your party, this trail works very well for a simple afternoon
										excursion to enjoy the weather and take in nature. For those who
										are interested, directions to the trail can be found here.
									  </p>

										<h2>Rivers, Mountains, and Other Trails</h2>

										<p>
										If you are fan of heights, we also suggest visiting the the Billy
										Goat Trail, which provides beautiful views of the Potomac river
										as well as a more active adventure for those who enjoy climbing.
										The unpaved trail is roughly 5 miles long, with multiple locations
										to enjoy the scenery and climb on large rocks. The trail also
										connects to a paved pathway for easy access to the Great Falls
										Tavern Visitor Center, where you can park. If you have additional
										time, we strongly recommend viewing the Great Falls rapids as well,
										either by following the paths near the visitor center, or by visiting
										the Great Falls National Park on the opposite side of the Potomac, in Virginia.
									  </p>
										<p>
										If you prefer mountains over rivers, Sugarloaf Mountain in Frederick County,
										Maryland is another great location to visit that isn’t extremely challenging,
										but very rewarding. With an elevation of 1,282 feet, Sugarloaf can be climbed
										quickly, while still providing beautiful views of the surrounding landscape. Hiking,
										rock climbing, horseback riding, and bird watching are all activities that visitors
										can enjoy at this location.
									  </p>
										<p>
										Additionally, picnic areas at the scenic overlook
										(which is accessible by car) and summit offer a
										great opportunity for friends and family to enjoy
										the outdoors alongside a meal.
										</p>
									  <p>
										If these trails don’t catch your attention, don’t fret!
										There are many more locations to visit in Maryland than we could
										possibly list. Feel free to visit http://www.alltrails.com,
										which is a wonderful resource complete with in-depth information
										and reviews of trails across the globe.

										<h2>Terrain</h2>
										<p>Within Maryland, there are vastly different types of environments to hike ranging from sandy
										beaches on the eastern seaboard to the mountainous western regions of Maryland. College Park is
										situated between these two extremes in an area known as the Piedmont region. The Piedmont is
										characterized by valleys and rolling hills leading up to the foothills of the Appalachian
										Mountains. Maryland offers a variety of different terrain to hike depending on how far you want
										to travel to get to your hiking location. With each type of terrain, there are different
										considerations that need to be taken in order to have a safe and enjoyable hiking experience.</p>
										<h3>Piedmont</h3>
										<p>The greatest challenge in the Piedmont region is the variety of terrain difficulty. The
										trails within the Piedmont can range from steep inclines to relatively flat lands. In order to
										prepare for the hike you want to take, it is important that you research the trail and search
										for reviews to get an understanding of the difficulty before you start. In Maryland, these
										trails tend to be closest to population centers, and are therefore better maintained, however
										they will possibly be more crowded.</p>
										<h3>Mountains</h3>
										<p>The mountainous areas of western Maryland have steeper inclines than the Piedmont region,
										and the incline can tire hikers out very easily. Trails in this region are generally unimproved
										and narrow, so be sure to follow the trail blazes and watch your step! There is also a larger
										prevalence of rock scrambles and jagged rocks, so proper footwear may be required for ankle
										support. If the incline is very steep, you can zigzag to decrease the gradient. Following
										switchbacks also preserves the trail and is safer than running straight down the hill, as
										tempting as it may be after working so hard going up!</p>
										<h3>Coastal Plain</h3>
										<p>Hiking at the beach introduces new challenges that are different than hiking anywhere else.
										Hiking along a beach may seem easy at first glance, but the constantly uneven and slippery sand
										stresses your legs more easily than hard, flat surfaces. Trails away from the waterfront will
										generally be hard-packed soil with few rocks or obstacles, except for the occasional tree root.
										Close proximity to the water introduces more insect life, so you should be sure to pack insect
										repellant to avoid unnecessary pain. The heat and the humidity at the beach can be dangerous to
										unprepared hikers. In order to fight the sun’s beams bring sunscreen, a hat, sunglasses, and
										extra drinking water.</p>

										<h2>Seasons</h2>
										<p>No matter what season you choose to go hiking, the weather and temperature are important to
										consider when planning a hike. Check the weather forecast leading up to your hike to avoid
										inclement weather situations and extreme temperatures. Depending on the season, you can enjoy a
										variety of different scenery: fall colors, snow-covered trees, and blossoming flowers. Each
										season bring hikers new experiences to enjoy.</p>
										<h3>Fall</h3>
										<p>As summer draws to a close and fall begins, the temperatures start to become more mild and
										humidity levels begin to drop. As the temperatures begin to decrease, the bright red, oranges,
										and yellows of fall foliage transform forested trails for hikers to enjoy. Another benefit of
										hiking during the fall is the reduction of mosquitoes, biting flies, and other insects from
										colder temperatures. As the fall weather continues to change, the highs and lows throughout the
										day can vary greatly. To prepare for the changing temperatures, pack extra layers in case the
										temperatures drop as the day progresses toward evening. Another downside of the changing weather
										are the cold rains that can catch hikers unprepared as fall continues. In order to avoid getting
										drenched in a rainstorm or thunderstorm, or make sure you bring appropriate raingear, make sure
										to check the weather forecast leading up to your hike.</p>
										<h3>Winter</h3>
										<p>Spring semester begins with winter where we’re all wishing for snow days to get out of class.
										Along with the promise of sleeping in, winter bring incredible views of snow covered trees and
										frozen rivers that you can see during a winter hike. December, January, and February are the
										coldest months of the winter in College park with average lows below freezing. Storms during
										winter bring snow or cold rain, both of which are dangerous because they can rapidly lower your
										body temperature. Long periods outside in cold temperatures will also lower your body temperature.
										With a low body temperature, it is more likely that you get hypothermia or frostbite, so you must
										make sure to wear appropriate clothing and boots that will keep your body warm. Some key winter
										accessories to wear hiking are winter coats, gloves, hats, thick socks, and winter boots. If you
										are walking on snow, it is important that the boots you wear are waterproof to prevent frostbite
										on your toes. In addition to proper clothing, eating extra food prevents hypothermia because it
										provides your body with more energy to produce heat. If your fingers, toes, or other appendages
										start to feel numb, immediately make sure they are dry and add more layers to add warmth.</p>
										<h3>Spring</h3>
										<p>Spring is beginning and that means new life! Flowers start popping out of the ground and buds
										appear on trees. With new life comes a lot of rain, which means the majority of hiking in the
										spring is going to be very muddy. Be aware of cold spells; be sure to pack extra layers if it is
										going to be cold during your hike.Waterproof clothing and packs are important for this season to
										keep yourself and your supplies dry in case of rain. </p>
										<h3>Summer</h3>
										<p>The first few weeks of fall semester and the last few weeks of spring semester are the hottest
										days most of us experience on campus, unless you are staying over the summer. With extreme heat
										and humidity, hikers must be extra cautious to stay hydrated. Hikers should also be aware of air
										quality alerts that indicate elevated levels of pollution that may be unhealthy for those with
										sensitive respiratory systems and popup thunderstorms that can break branches and cause flash
										flooding along the trail. That being said, summer offers longer days that make an evening hike
										possible without racing to beat sunset.</p>
