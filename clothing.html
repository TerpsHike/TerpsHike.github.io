											<h2>Gear</h2>
											<p>Whether you’re doing a five-mile loop near your house or spending a week on the side of a mountain,
												having the right gear for a trip will keep you safe and comfortable.</p>
										</header>
										<h2>Footwear</h2>
										<p>Generally, most of the outdoor activities you’ll participate in will require some sort of hiking boot.
										It can be difficult to pick out a shoe that suits your needs, so having a good understanding of hiking
										boot composition is important. We’ll go over the upper, the midsole, and the outsole.</p>
										<p>A boot’s “upper” is the part of the boot that extends past the ankle. These vary greatly in size and material, with a short
										upper being better for day hiking and a higher one meant for long backpacking trips with heavier weights.
										Full leather uppers are extremely tough and durable, making them best for rough terrain. Split leather/nylon
										mixes are less tough, but are more breathable; a good option if you are hiking on hot days in muggy weather.
										If you are planning on hiking in wet climates, a waterproof-membrane upper sacrifices durability for
										air-tightness. As a Maryland hiker, we recommend a split leather upper, as it's the most flexible option
										and ideal for a novice.</p>
										<p>The midsole of a hiking boot is the main body of the shoe, and supports the foot and ankle.
										They vary mostly on material and stiffness. The most common midsole material is EVA (ethylene
										vinyl acetate), which is inexpensive and makes for a less-firm midsole. While it can be layered for a
										stiffer boot, it's better to go for polyurethane if that's what you’re after. This is the more expensive
										material, and is usually best for intense hiking. We recommend focusing more on the feet of the boot than on
										the material. Unlike other components, the midsole will not adjust much to your foot, so it's a good idea to
										make sure it's comfortable when you buy it.</p>
										<p>The final important element of a hiking boot is the the outsole. This is the material that actually
										separates you from the ground, so we recommend always getting a rubber one. No other material is really
										acceptable or widely used. The biggest decision point on the outsole is
										firm versus soft. A soft outsole will give you excellent traction and grip, but it is generally less durable
										and will wear faster. A firm sole, often rubber mixed with a little carbon, is extremely durable and will
										last you longer, but may fare worse on slippery surfaces. This is a matter of personal preference, but in
										Maryland you’ll probably find that the hard sole is a better choice.</p>
										<p>A final thing to remember is that most hiking boots are made mostly of leather. This is great for long
										term durability and support, but it means that it needs time to form to the shape of your foot. Make sure
										you wear your new boots around before you hike in them, or you’re going to have painful feet!</p>

										<h2>Jackets</h2>
										<p>Jackets are extremely important to every hiker, especially in the winter or at high altitudes. If you’re
										only planning on doing day hikes in mild weather you can hold off on this purchase, but otherwise this is
										something to focus on. There are three types of jackets: the shell jacket, the insulated jacket, and the fleece.</p>
										<p>Shell jackets are designed to be defense against wind and rain. They aren’t the warmest, as they are usually
										designed to be small and lightweight. A shell jacket is pretty much non-negotiable on any long hiking trip,
										as you can never predict the rain and without one you’re in big trouble. The upside to this is that they are
										really easy to fit into a backpack and they won’t add much weight. When you buy your shell, make sure you’re
										wearing what you would on a rainy hike! The shell isn’t insulating so it needs to be big enough to wear over
										your other layers. </p>
										<p>An insulating jacket, often referred to as a “puffy” by hikes, is a very warm jacket similar to the types
										worn on ski slopes. Unlike the shell, you can get away with leaving this one at home if you know you’re not
										going to be in cold weather. When shopping for a puffy, you want to keep warmth and weight in mind most of
										all. They are generally filled with synthetic material and polyester based to wick moisture out and keep heat
										in. Never bring a cotton jacket on a hike (cotton anything is bad, really), and make sure that it's small
										enough to fit inside your backpack. Don’t worry about wind resistance or waterproofing! You’ll always have
										your shell with you and can wear it over this.</p>
										<p>Lastly, the fleece is the lightest jacket you can get and is best for chill temperatures in a dry environment.
										Again, this should be made of polyester, should be fairly insulating, and doesn’t need to be waterproof. You
										can also get a wool fleece if you prefer breathability and warmth to moisture resistance and lightness, but
										for novice hikers synthetic material is the way to go because it's versatile and easy to maintain.</p>
										<p>The most important thing to remember with jackets is that you’ll be adding and removing layers the whole time
										that you’re hiking, especially on longer hikes and especially in Maryland’s unpredictable climate. By mixing and
										matching these jackets, you can protect yourself from inclement weather of all types. Remember this when you’re
										choosing your jacket! Front zippers are important for changing on the go, and a looser fit means you can wear
										it over other layers. </p>

										<h2>Backpacks</h2>
										<p>When looking for a backpack to suit your hiking needs, the first thing to figure out is how long you’re
										planning to be out. Longer trips require a larger pack, but if you prefer to hike on the weekends you don’t
										want the extra weight. There are generally three categories of backpacks: weekend, multi-day, and extended
										trip. Look for these or similar names when you’re choosing your pack. As a novice hiker, you’re going to be
										looking for a frame backpack, which means that the backpack is built around a metal frame and is supported
										by your core rather than your shoulders. If you’re only going out for the afternoon you might get away with
										using your school bag, but nothing much longer than that. Internal-frame backpacks are the most common, as
										they are more compact and comfortable. If you’re someone who wants extra ventilation and likes to hang
										things off the frame, an external-frame pack is what you’re looking for.</p>
										<p>When choosing your pack, make sure you pay attention to “pack access”, or how easy it is to get to your
										stuff. If you’re short or not flexible you might want a pack with lots of side pockets. Also make absolutely
										sure that you have a rain cover for your pack before you hit the woods. Many backpacks are sold with a
										fitting rain cover, but make sure to get one yourself if it's not included.</p>
										<p>The fit of the pack is also very important. In most cases the two measurements that matter are torso
										length and waist thickness. You don’t want your bag to tower over you or push against your neck, so try it
										on first to check the height. Some packs can be adjusted for this, but that shouldn’t be assumed. The width
										of the pack and its hipbelt is another huge factor. Your hips generally support about 75% of your weight
										when you hike with a frame backpack, so checking that the fit is good and comfortable and crucial.  If you’re
										really attached to a particular model, the hipbelt can be replaced, but this is a lot of work and generally
										not worth it. </p>

										<h2>Other Gear Tips</h2>
										<p>Your footwear, harsh-weather gear, and backpack are the most important items for a novice hiker to own, so
										those are the ones we focus on the most. That being said, you will need a lot more before you’re ready for
										difficult hiking. Overnight trips will generally require a tent, which needs to be extremely small and
										lightweight since you’ll have it on your back all day. You’ll also need to carry tent spikes, a rain cover,
										and rope to properly make camp. In the same vein, you’ll need to pick a sleeping bag. Focus on lightweight
										material and warmth, although for Maryland hiking you generally won't need protection from extreme cold.</p>
										<p>Hikers need to be prepared. Even if you’re not leading a hike, you should make sure you have first aid
										materials, illumination, matches, water, and some form of navigation (map, GPS, and compass). You never know
										if you’ll be separated from your group or caught in harsh conditions.</p>
										<p>On top of these essentials, it's important to keep in mind that lots of different trips and activities
										require unique gear. It's a good idea to plan out the things you’ll need for things like canoeing, spelunking,
										or climbing, as your basic hiking gear won’t cover it.</p>
										<p>All of this gear can get very expensive, and it's no secret that owning all of it yourself is a real
										challenge. Luckily, if you’re at the University of Maryland you have another option. Joining the Terrapin Trail
										Club will give you access to a ton of awesome, campus owned gear, as well as lots of great advice and feedback
										about what to use. You can also rent gear, or borrow it from other hikers. Start with getting the essentials,
										buy gears that lasts, and before long you’ll have everything you need!</p>
